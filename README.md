# About me

I am a PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech, where I'm a member of the NerDS Lab as well as part of the larger ML@GT and GT Neuro research communities. I have the privilege of being advised by Dr. Eva Dyer, with whom I work on addressing open questions in computational neuroscience using tools from applied mathematics, digital signal processing and machine learning.
